Site: Interactive Weekly Planner

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to:
- Organize my to-do list according to time throughout each day of the week for one week
- Input tasks for each day and time period 
- Edit tasks as needed from the overview page
- Clear tasks at the end of the week 

Acceptance Criteria:
- When I open the page, I see a pop-up where there is an overview and I can choose the option to add a new task or exit.

- When I click on an “Add New Task” button, a page opens to add a task, details, and determine the day and time period it needs to occur, as well as its importance.

- When I add a task, the website adds it to a selected day and specific time period on the main overview page and organizes it by time and importance.

- After the event is added, I have the option to add another task or return to the main overview page.

- When I click on “Clear Planner,” the list of tasks is cleared to begin a new week.
